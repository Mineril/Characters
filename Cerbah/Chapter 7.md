#### The Playful Undead Jester Jevekler
***
After a while Cerbah understood 3 things while fighting her opponent, the first one is whenever he throws his head he can instantly damage someone based on the amount of steps they take, the second thing she noticed is after he reattaches his head he sits and laughs hysterically for up to 5 seconds before he continues swinging his scythe, and the third and final thing is when he gets on his unicycle there's no reason in getting near him because he swings and moves too fast to dodge any of his attacks. Cerbah while dodging and summoning tried coming up with a strategy but Jevekler did something that shocked even her.

Jevekler: *Alright then if you wont get close to me I'll get close to you come to papa kiddo!*

Suddenly Jevekler threw his head in Cerbah's Direction and appeared right in front of her as if he teleported. Cerbah quickly jumped back and summoned an undead army of 100 solders containing skeletons zombies and ghouls before Jevekler could swing his scythe cutting her head clean off.

Jevekler: *SWING BATTER BATTER SWING AND THERE IT GOES THERE IT GOES AND HE MISSES BY JUST A HAIR. OHHH BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!*

Cerbah saw Jevekler throw his head in the air again but this time didn't take a single step but her other minions were moving around sporadically then they all suddenly died when he reattached his head. and as per usual loudly calling for one of her minions hiding to chop off his head. The minion proceeded to chop of Jeveklers head and throw it at her while he was still sporadically laughing.

Jevekler: *It's funny because hehe because I'm undead chopping off my head wont do anything.*

Cerbah hit Jevekler's head and shook it around for a bit before his body got up and started to move around to try and find it's head. Cerbah knew it was the perfect time to strike then suddenly a fleet of skeletons with bows and arrows started attacking Jevekler's' body until nothing was left. Cerbah grunted in victory as she finally defeated him. his head was still in her arms though and before she started walking off to the dungeon Jevekler spoke to her. "*Oh boy wait until the boys hear about this one, it's going to be a knee slapper, so uhm you have any funny jokes or no?*". Cerbah threw Jevekler's head and it stood up and flew back towards her.

Jevekler's head: "*Rude much anyways you don't talk much do you?*"

Cerbah grunted and growled at his head before he hushed her the bit her ear. "*Alright now try to speak, i can't be on a journey with someone who can barely form words*". Cerbah screamed out in pain "*HOLY SHIT THAT HURT WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.... WHATS WRONG WITH ME WHY AM I SPEAKING THE HUMANS LANGUAGE WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME!*" Jevekler laughed before explaining himself "*It's always so funny when they do that never fails to put a smile on my face.*" Cerbah paused for a moment before speaking again "*What kind of  uhm sorcery is this?*" Jevekler did nothing but laugh hysterically as they walked off towards their next location.

*Now that Cerbah can talk the story will be told from her perspective rather  than from yours*
