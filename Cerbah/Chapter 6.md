#### The Lich King
***
*"OH CERBAH MY SWEET GOBLIN YOU HAVE SHOWN ME SO MUCH POTENTIAL AND I HAVE TO SAY IT HAS BEEN QUITE ENJOYABLE. I was planning to kill you but then I thought why get rid of such a wonderful protégé so lucky for you i spared your life but such a gift doesn't come for free my young apprentice. You well not that you have any say but since i spared your life you have to travel back to the dungeon where you first learned necromancy and defeat me. in order to take my place as the lich king. If you don't I'll just take your life here."*. Cerbah saw a large boney hand being placed in front of her. ash she thought briefly about the decision she agreed and went out to touch the Lich King's hand. The Lich King evaporated all of the cuffs and shackled holding Cerbah down and then spoke one last time before he vanished and left a weird looking clown skeleton in his place. *"I do hope to see you soon Cerbah iv'e been waiting for a successor for decades. But anyways i bestow my gift upon you my young goblin friend. Also watch out for Jevekler he's a bit of a jokester. but don't let his happy demeanor fool you he's pretty hard to fight and no one is safe from his impractical jokes. Goodbye"*. And Just like that the Lich King vanished and now Cerbah was left alone with this so called jokester along with thousands of screaming and panicking humans. But then suddenly all the humans just up and died instantly as if some kind of elaborate prank was being played on Cerbah.

Suddenly Jevekler turned to Cerbah and spoke. "*Oh boy so you're this goblin the Lich King has been talking about if he speaks so highly of you this will be a fun fight i guarantee it HAA HAHAHA!*". Then suddenly a huge scythe flew towards Cerbah's neck with little to no notice and at that moment all Cerbah could do was duck and dodge his attacks.

Jevekler: *COME ON FIGHT BACK THIS IS NO FUN IS IF ALL YOU DO IS EVADE!*

Cerbah summoned the undead but something felt off about these ones for once they weren't only skeletons but also zombies, and from what she observed they were much stronger than anything she has summoned before or after her mental struggles. One of Cerbah's skeleton minions shot a barrage of arrows at Jevekler. before he laughed sporadically and started spinning his scythe completely knocking away all the arrows.

Jevekler: *Haha that's what I was looking for its no fun if I'm the only one attacking!*

Suddenly Jevekler threw his head into the hair and Cerbah ran around sporadically trying to evade what ever attack he was planning to throw at her, but nothing happened and as soon as he reattached his head to his body she felt as if 100 knives were just stabbed into her back. Jevekler laughed hysterically as he was rolling on the ground holding his stomach. Cerbah could barely move her arms as she tried reaching for the left over food she kept between her chest if anything bad were to ever happen to her.

Jevekler: *No please wait  I'm not done laughing this is too funny I can't believe you actually fell for it!*

Cerbah was confused about what just happened but she had no time to think about the events that played out. Cerbah summoned more of her minions this time in larger and larger groups as she tried to keep distance from Jevekler's attacks but it always seemed pointless cause no matter how far from him she was she took damage regardless be it tons of damage or little, Cerbah was quickly running out of stored food and all she had left were plants she found safe to eat a while back. Cerbah didn't know what to do but regardless she knew she couldn't keep running from her opponent forever.
